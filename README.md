## Pan American Health ML Shipping Calculator & Deployment Pipeline
[ML Shipping Calculator – Design, Pipeline & Prototype](https://github.com/thatritikpatel/Shipping-Cost-Prediction/blob/54da4b46204bb1b175e983be94533a9350e810db/README.md)
[Implementation & Code Breakdown] (https://github.com/uiuc-ischool-center-health-informatics/paho-freight/blob/7449517ddd0dfc0bba38878e58d0c75815ddab20/Final.ipynb)

This team project with PAHO showcases an end-to-end ML system for predicting shipping costs, covering data preprocessing, model training, and deployment in a functional web app. The first link provides the project overview and prototype, while the second link includes the full codebase with detailed explanations.

## NBA Longevity Classifer Analysis
[NBA Classifier GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jcrizzo2/Jaclyn-Rizzo-Resume.github/blob/2a2013eea743bcbc85d759a3c9151c783a692090/lab_12.ipynb)

Built a logistic regression model to predict NBA player longevity using performance metrics (PTS, AST, REB, FG%). Evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix, accuracy/sensitivity/specificity calculations, and ROC–AUC analysis to assess classification thresholds.

## Video Game Console Analysis
[Video Games GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jcrizzo2/Jaclyn-Rizzo-Resume.github/blob/ca2f69c2c3e2532ce3c0f156090642f31271b029/project_01_template.ipynb)

Analyzed a video game dataset to examine how U.S. sales vary across consoles, applying data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualization techniques to ensure accurate comparisons. The results highlight platform-specific sales trends, offering insights for data-driven market strategy in the gaming industry.

## Project Mosaic
[Mosaic GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jcrizzo2/Jaclyn-Rizzo-Resume.github/blob/d6bf5c37b389c9440b3d171d012d8c0f8a32ff73/mosaic.ipynb)

Built a Python program that generated an image mosaic by arranging small color tiles into a larger picture.

## Liverpool Football Data Analysis
[Football GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jcrizzo2/Jaclyn-Rizzo-Resume.github/blob/b968885b27f9488e04c6e477916b6eca47633ba6/project2.ipynb)

Created data visualizations by grouping key metrics, highlighting patterns and trends in player performance.
Conducted a two-sample t-test on the goals column, interpreted the p-value, and evaluated statistical significance.

## C++ Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer
[Visualizer GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jcrizzo2/Jaclyn-Rizzo-Resume.github/blob/a20e681bb30fd870245bb34a71b2a082edc330e5/Project.cpp)

Implemented and visualized core data structures (linked list, stack, queue, binary tree) in C++ using object-oriented programming and modular design.
Developed an interactive console-based application to simulate real-time insertions, deletions, and traversals for educational purposes.
Applied clean coding practices with header/source file separation, dynamic memory management, and user-friendly console visualizations.
