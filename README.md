Created data visualizations by grouping key metrics, highlighting patterns and trends in player performance.
Conducted a two-sample t-test on the goals column, interpreted the p-value, and evaluated statistical significance.

## C++ Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer
[Visualizer GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jcrizzo2/Jaclyn-Rizzo-Resume.github/blob/a20e681bb30fd870245bb34a71b2a082edc330e5/Project.cpp)

Implemented and visualized core data structures (linked list, stack, queue, binary tree) in C++ using object-oriented programming and modular design.
Developed an interactive console-based application to simulate real-time insertions, deletions, and traversals for educational purposes.
Applied clean coding practices with header/source file separation, dynamic memory management, and user-friendly console visualizations.
